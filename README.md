Torque3D-Tutorials
==================

A repository with tutorial projects and guides to help new user get started with T3D.
The repo contains 3 folders.

"Tutorials" - Contains the tutorials in both PDF and tex form. PDF for viewing and tex for editing.<br />

"TutorialBase" - Contains a binary with just the necessary files, set up for the tutorials specifically. This is a good base to start from.

"CoinCollectionGame" - Contains the game made from the tutorials in it's finished form.

(TutorialBase and CoinCollectionGame folders is still WIP therefore not committed yet)

#Tutorial 1#
In the first tutorial I guide you through setting up the environment to be *Torque Ready* and we will start creating our first simple game.

This tutorial also contains lots of useful information about TorqueScript and will introduce you to the basics of TorqueScript

This tutorial should be very useful for absolute beginners to Torque3D, if you have some experience you should still follow the scripts created in this tutorial as we will use them for the next tutorials.

By the end of this tutorial you will have:
* A basic single player coin collection game.
  * Run into coins to get points.
  * When there is no more coins left in the game, the game terminates with a "you win" screen.

#Tutorial 2#
Now this is where the sample game gets very nifty! We will look at how to make a Torque 3D game multiplayer compatible and our CoinCollection game will, after this tutorial, support multiplayer!

We will also look at dynamic object instancing and how to define your own datablocks.

By the end of this tutorial you will have:
* A basic multiplayer coin collection game.
  * Run into coins to get points.
  * The guy with most coins will get a "you win" message.
  * Everyone who did not have the most coins will get a "you lost" message.
  * When picking up coins, a sparkly burst will appear.

#Tutorial 3#
In this tutorial we will look at creating our own scoreboard for the coin collection game.

Now we can keep track of whos in charge in the game! And get a basic understanding of how the GUI work in T3D.

By the end of this tutorial you will have:
* A basic multiplayer coin collection game.
  * Run into coins to get points.
  * The guy with most coins will get a "you win" message.
  * Everyone who did not have the most coins will get a "you lost" message.
  * When picking up coins, a sparkly burst will appear.
  * Press 'F' to get a nifty scoreboard which will keep track of the score at all players.
